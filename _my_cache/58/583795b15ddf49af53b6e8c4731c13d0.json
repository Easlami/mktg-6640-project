The space is definitely on the smaller and more intimate side--good for a date but probably not for a big crowd since they were turning away parties bigger than 6. We found this place on social media and decided to give it a try. Service was a bit slow but I get it, they're newer. The server was nice and tried to pay attention to all the tables but definitely getting overwhelmed.As for the food, we got two things: the assorted savory pancakes and the octopus/pork belly.The assorted pancakes were good. I initially thought for $40 it's a little steep but it comes with an assortment of different foods--stuffed peppers, stuffed mushroom, king oyster mushroom, Korean sausage, meatball, etc. You don't see a lot of places in Koreatown that has ì „ in that capacity.The octopus/pork belly dish was okay--the dish came out warm, not hot, but it didn't taste bad.Tl;drOverall, I think Butnal is a cool spot to go for a lowkey night. Food is okay. Space is small so don't go with a big crowd."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["neutral"]}
