But the bulgogi was really savory.  The prime beef lemon pepper burrito was impressive and my favorite thing about Hanshik.  The tacos were pretty good as well.  The wings were really crispy and juicy on the inside.  I really enjoyed the wings. They do have a lot of flavor."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
