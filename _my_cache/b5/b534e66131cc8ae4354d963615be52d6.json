The answer is based on the following text:\nAlways loved their Kimchi Soup but had no idea they had Raw Marinated Crab on the menu too!  Their combination plate is well worth it.  You get a full entree in addition to your choice of soup!  Not to mention all traditional Korean sides that are bottomless.  The price point and portion size is very worth it!  You get to pick your desired spice level and the medium was just perfect.  The only complaint I have is that their kids menu was for ages 7 and under!  They seriously expected a 10 year old to eat a full entree???  My daughter ended up sharing with me but that means I had to get chicken teriyaki instead of the spicy chicken which is unfortunate as I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more.  Other than that, staff was friendly, the wait was short, and the food was great."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
