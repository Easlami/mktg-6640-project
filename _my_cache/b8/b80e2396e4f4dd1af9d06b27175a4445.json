The answer is based on the following text:\nMy partner and I decided to come here after browsing through highly rated restaurants on Yelp and it did NOT disappoint. If anything, I have now left with one of my new favorite places to eat in DTLA! Tim, the owner of Broken Mouth, was the person to take our order, and he was so incredibly kind and friendly! His hospitality alone is an 11/10. We ended up ordering a beef plate and a shrimp plate. We were also given a SPAM musubi and our drinks on the house as it was our first time! It wasn't busy when we came in the late afternoon so we waited roughly 10 minutes for our food. When our food got called out and we unpacked it at our table, we were speechless it all looked so amazing. Not only did it look amazing, it tasted so incredibly wonderful. The shrimp on my palate were nearly as big as my fist and were bursting with flavor. The beef on my partners plate was so tender and flavorful as well! Also, the greens come so well seasoned and the purple rice is perfectly cooked! I would certainly re-order both plates! The complimentary SPAM musubi was also so grand; I will definitely add it to my next order! Overall, if you are in the DTLA area, I highly recommend Broken Mouth. The service, food, and overall quality is worth every penny. The owner, Tim, mentioned he has dreams/goals of opening a sit-down restaurant. Please support this business so he can get there! You will not regret this dining experience!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
