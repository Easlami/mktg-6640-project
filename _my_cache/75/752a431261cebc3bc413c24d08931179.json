The answer is based on the following text:\nFirst of all, I LOVED the parking situation. Korean restaurants in KTown parking situations can be challenging. There were plenty of parking spaces which made it so easy to come.The space inside is small but it wasn't as crowded since we got there early. The server was attentive and brought more refill banchan.Since the name of the restaurant is Yuk Dae Jang, I had to try Yukgaejang. It was good but nothing outstanding. However, their naengmyeon was so refreshing and delicious! I highly recommend it. We also got mandu. Kimchi mandu was pretty good but the pork mandu had this aftertaste I did not like.Overall, I would come back again for the ease of parking and Naengmyeon. I will try other items next time."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
