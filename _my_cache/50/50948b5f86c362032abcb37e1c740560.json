The answer is based on the following text:\nHighly recommend! This is THE place for a filling bowl of knife cut noodles in Koreatown. Handmade noodles in broth with such depth in flavor, each slurp warms your soul and each bowl feels like a snug hug. Perfect after a long day at work! Also loved the barley rice appetizer, 3 types of kimchi, and tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes). Very friendly service and cute interior decor."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
