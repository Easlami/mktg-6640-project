The answer is based on the following text:\nWent here with a friend who had never eaten Korean food before. We got a seafood pancake and the mackerel. Both were delicious. The mackerel was cooked well but a bit plain - I didn't want to get anything too crazy or spicy since my friend and I were sharing. The decor is lovely, it was packed full of Korean families. Service was timely and efficient. Wish I could eat here one more time while I still live in Ktown, but I'll have to make a drive and fight for parking next time. Absolutely recommend, great place to take visitors or people new to Korean food."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
