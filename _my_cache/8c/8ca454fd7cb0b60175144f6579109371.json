We called ahead of time to make sure we could get in. The food was all reasonably priced and was some of the best Korean pub type food I have had. Great corn cheese, awesome seafood pancake, really good rice cakes, and great popcorn chicken. The staff was extremely friendly and a lot of fun. I look forward to coming here again with my friends"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
