The answer is based on the following text:\nFoodI've been to this place quite a few times and I can say that this place has some good korean bbq. They have a good selection of self serve marinated meats and other food such as karaage , radish, kimchi, japchae, etc. I have to say the japchae is really good and a stand out. They also have a good basic selection of meats that you can order in a menu. This place is a bit on the pricier but given the amount you can choose from it is quite understandable. The quality of the meat themselves are pretty okay. The prime sirloin steak is definitely our go to order most of the time as it seems to be the highest quality one that they have. The brisket and beef belly are also good choices. They have a good variety of side dishes too that can help give a break in between meats.Service/AmbianceThis place is packed most of the time, but the staff were still nice and accommodating with pretty quick service."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
