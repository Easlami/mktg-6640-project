I've been here before, and the food + ambiance never disappoint.This visit, we ordered Combo C since we wanted a set with beef and the marinated short rib. They had two options to cook the meat: they can cook it in the kitchen or cook it in front of you like the traditional KBBQ restaurants. We were served by Rose, who's very friendly and attentive to our needs. Sure enough, the food was great and they have great drinks selections which is perfect if you want to hang with your friend. We definitely enjoyed our experience dining here and are looking forward to coming back here again!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
