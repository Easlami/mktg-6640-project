The answer is based on the following text:\nVisited for a late lunch and had a mixed experience with both the food and service. Our order included the spicy raw crab, braised beef short ribs with cheese, and beer.Starting with the positives, the banchan assortment was delightful. I particularly enjoyed the spicy raw crab, although it was a touch too sauced. It paired well with rice. However, the braised beef short ribs left me disappointed.The first piece I picked up was a rice cake. Just before taking a bite, I noticed a faint sour smell. Despite that, I proceeded, finding the taste alright. Eventually, I realized the odor originated from the melted cheese topping. Unfortunately, the cheese had gone bad, casting a negative shadow over the dish and affecting my overall meal experience.Though the staff was friendly, their lack of attentiveness was noticeable. There was no check-in during the meal, despite our wish for banchan refills, water, and an additional beer. We even had to signal for assistance to order more rice, which should ideally be a standard accompaniment. Additionally, the rice served was dense and lacked fluffiness, further diminishing the experience.It would have been appreciated if the staff inquired about our meal satisfaction, but they were rather quick to present the bill and depart. Hoping for a more well-rounded experience next time."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
