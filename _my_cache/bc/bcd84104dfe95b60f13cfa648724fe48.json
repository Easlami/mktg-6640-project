The service we got from Tim (the owner) was amazing! He's one of the kindest and most passionate owners I've met. He went through his entire menu with us, which made figuring out what to get a breeze! I got the beef plate and my fianc√©e got the shrimp plate, along with spam musubi, and two soft drinks. The food was DELICIOUS! We'll definitely be coming back again not just for the food, but Tim's welcoming and exceptional service. This is a MUST TRY if you're in LA. You won't be disappointed."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
