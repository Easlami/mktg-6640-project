The answer is based on the following text:\nHad the pleasure of meeting a friend after a long time of not seeing each other and decided to take him to an AYCE restaurant Korean BQ place and found the perfect spot in the Koreatown part of Los Angeles, there is validated parking under the building and they can extend it to two hours. The food selection was impressive wherein you can order the prime cuts of beef from a menu and the regular marinated meats was already in the counter for you to cook as you wait for the prime cut to come from the kitchen. The place was clean and the staff took the time to check up on your needs and the steel grill was constantly replaced to ensure clean cooking. The service was fast and since it was not busy at that time for lunch, they extended the time limit to two hours instead of the usual 90 minutes. My friend, who is white was thoroughly impressed that he left a huge tip that to me, being Asian was amazed. The bathrooms were clean and had actual hot running water. I highly recommend this but be prepared to wait as the lines can get very long."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
