The flavors of each dish is really tasty and flavorful-- you know the chefs worked hard to create it. Service was great, really friendly chefs and staffs. Parking is not too bad if you're ok with valet parking. Valet doesn't take card or Venmo so make sure to prepare $3/4 of cash to park. If not, I'm sure there's plenty of street parking available outside! They offer drinks here as well, my favorite non alcoholic drink was this Japanese plum drink. Anyways, thank you hibi for a great experience-- will def be back!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
