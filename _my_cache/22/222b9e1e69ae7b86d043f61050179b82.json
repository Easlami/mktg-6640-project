We came here for my sister in laws birthday around 5pm on a Sunday. We had reservations but the place didn't seem crowded at all. We were seated and ordered the package for 4+ people that comes with a few different meat options and we also added the tomahawk to our order. We were 6 adults and 1 toddler that can eat a ton! And this was enough food for us! All the meats were so tender and honestly the best quality compared to all you can eat places! They give you radish paper, pickles, salad , rice, kimchi and potato salad. That stuff is all unlimited! I must have ate 3 whole bowls myself of the pickles they were so good!Staff was friendly and quick! Definitely would come back.10 dollar parking lot across the street"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
