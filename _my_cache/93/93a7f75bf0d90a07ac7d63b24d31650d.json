The answer is based on the following text:\nThis place actually surprised me! We came here after a Kings game at the Staples Center cause we were craving some late night Korean bites.Although we didn't order an alcohol here, I could definitely see this place as a great hangout spot to pregame before going out or just in general a great space to get a bit lit! There are different rooms in this place, but they were only seating everyone in the room with the movie-theme.We ordered two plates: the chicken gizzard and the spicy intestines. Both were great however I was hoping that there would be slightly more gizzard and intestines in each dish compared to ratio of the onions, garlic, etc.I was also a bit bummed that they did not have chili paste at all. They did have sriracha and gochujang so that sufficed.Our server was nice, but at some point he started eating with his other colleague and so flagging him down for the check in the end was a bit harder.Overall, a relatively decent option in the east end of Ktown! Parking was ok for us because it was a Monday night and pretty late, but the lot was still like 90% full, so I can't imagine how the situation would be on a weekend night."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["neutral"]}
