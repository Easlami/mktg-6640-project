The answer is based on the following text:\nDo not make this a last minute trip to try the big steak dinner! Make sure you put in a request no later than 2pm for that. But since we made a last minute dinner reservation all of the other food dishes were DELICIOUS! Definitely get yourself the mushroom rice and the bone marrow dip. By far the tastiest food I had and we went in a group of 4 and easily shared all of the meals with each other. If you're a drinker, stick to their curated drinks and do not veer off the menu. The ambience outside was nice and quiet, it's right on Naud street and in a little cut, so it's a perfect getaway for a relaxing date."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
