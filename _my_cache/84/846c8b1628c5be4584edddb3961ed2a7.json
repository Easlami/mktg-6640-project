The answer is based on the following text:\nMy bf and I were craving jokbal on Friday night and decided to try this new place. We got the medium-sized jokbal platter, and the server gave a side of soondae for us to try. Both the jokbal and the soondae were so good. At first, we thought it was too much food for two, but then ended up finishing everything. They also give plenty of ssam, aka lettuce wraps. The jokbal didn't have a smell at all, and the place felt super clean. I would definitely come back to try their spicy jokbal and their makguksoo."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
