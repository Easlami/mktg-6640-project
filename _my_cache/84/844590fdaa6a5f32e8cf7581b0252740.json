The answer is based on the following text:\nFound this spot for a late night korean meal on a chilly night after a going to a comedy show. Was excited to have some large intestines and ordered what I thought I will be getting based on the picture on the menu but instead, I was served with a small plate and the portion is very underwhelming and disappointing. I spoke to one of the servers to clarify about the portion size comparing the pic on the menu and got the impression that they were basically falsely advertising. Our server only checked in once to refill water and didn't come back anymore to see what else we needed. As much as I love korean food, I will unfortunately charging this to experience and won't be returning."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
