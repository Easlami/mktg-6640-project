The answer is based on the following text:\nWe came early on a Sunday evening, and was able to beat the dinner rush with no wait. I really loved the open seating. The decor was pretty modern yet felt homey. I ordered the chicken kalguksu and was very surprised to see how big the portion was. I'd say it was very worth it at its price. The broth was light and easy to eat, while still being well seasoned. Definitely a super comforting meal. The sides were also really good as well. Service was swift but the attentiveness/care was a bit lacking. For starters, the menus were thrown onto the table as we were being seated. An alarming eyebrow raiser for sure. Â It also took awhile for someone to take notice of us. Not a huge issue though. Otherwise, would give a 5/5. I'd come here again to try the bossam."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
