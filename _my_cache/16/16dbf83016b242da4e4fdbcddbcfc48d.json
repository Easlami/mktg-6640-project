The answer is based on the following text:\nOnly reason I give this place one star is because there's no option to select zero star!Based on the customer service we received from this Asian girl staff, made me and my partner to walk out of the restaurant.When we selected Korean spicy rib as one of the entree option, she was filling up dinner box with bones with no meat on it. We sincerely asked her if that option can be replace with other menu since only bones are left and she said \"I can't because I already put this food (several pieces of bones) on the dinner box and that can't be replace with other menu option.\"We were just appalled by her response and decided to walk out the restaurant.Isn't it common sense that if there are no meat and only bones are left, staff needs to take it off from food menu and inform customer that it's sold out and have them select different entree.If that selection was a fish entree, I bet she would give me fish bones and would tell me that she can't take it off because I chose that option and once that bones are put it into the dinner box, you can't take it off nor replace with other menu.I am just really upset how this ignorant and imprudently trained staff could treat customer with this type manner. We are paying for not only good food but service as well.How are some of these Elite Yelp reviewers gave this place five stars.To restaurant owner or staff manager:I stopped by your restaurant at 7/7/24 Friday at 6:00pm. This staff needs to be addressed and retrained. Customers are not stupid. We are going to your place expecting good food and decent service. We've always trust food quality and service from Chef Kang's restaurants.When did Korean rib bones became a new trending menu!This location"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
