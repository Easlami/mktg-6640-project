The answer is based on the following text:\nGot a chance to try out broken mouth and ordered the spam musubi, chicken plate, and beef plate.Spam musibi - 4/5; the seasoning is really flavorful throughout but for me the spam itself was a little too salty and there was too much rice (but we just used it to eat the other plates)Chicken - 5/5; our favorite dish. The chicken was cooked great with a nice char. Perfect with the rice and saladBeef - 3/5 my biggest complaint is there's is not enough beef in the dish. I honestly was confused at first because I could not figure out where the beef was as all I could find was the egg batter. The sauces were really good but for the price of this dish I wasn't impressed."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["neutral"]}
