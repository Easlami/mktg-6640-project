The answer is based on the following text:\nThis finally happened!! When I was studying at UCLA, we tried making plans a few times, especially after our trip to Momofuku in Vegas - but ended up not happening! And, then covid caused all that pause!So, I was coming back to LA for a weekend trip, and I thought to give it another try. Asked a friend if he wanted to join, and both of us finally made it to Majordomo!Got reservation relatively easily a couple of days before, thankfully, and the place was packed on the Friday night!!And, then we started ordering things - from a bottle of sake to some starting dishes like tuna tataki and their famous bing flatbread (with bone marrow of course), and the crispy potatoes (a fun tip: eat these potatoes with the bone marrow dip and maybe add a tiny bit of that kimchi sauce that comes with oysters.. so yum ;)) Oh, and the clay pot rice - we got the duck one!! So yum! And, the pork! And, had to finish with pavlova! Gotta visit again!Also, our server asked which one we would give a higher rating - momofuku vegas vs. majordomo LA.. both are amazing! But, momofuku vegas wins for me!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
