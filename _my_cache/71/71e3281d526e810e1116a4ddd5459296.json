The answer is based on the following text:\nThe food I currently tried:1. Seafood Soup $33- The soup is well-balanced and is delicious and probably goes good with rice.- The balance between protein (crabs, clams, muscle, prawns) and vegetable is off.- The crab meat was way too brittle and soggy I couldn't taste the crab.2. The Grilled King Octopus $33- Price: Uncertain- The sauce and the grill on the octopus is good- Quantity/Amount of octopus provided for a gastropub can be debate-able. (The portion size felt like a fine-dining portion size where you only get 1 king octopus leg - which is pretty small once cooked)3. The smoke crust salmon salad $24-Price : Good-Buy Again? : Yes-This taste really nice and there is good portion size would buy again.-Quality/quantity for price matches up4. Honey Garlic Chicken Wings - Half $14-Price : Good-Crunchiness: Not to my expectation when compare to other K-chicken.-Taste: Not to my expectation compare to other chef kang location from before.-Quantity for price matches up-Buy Again : Perhaps not5. Volcano Popcorn chicken - $26- Price: Uncertain- Taste : Decent- Extremely Spicy- Crunchiness : Not to my expectation compare to other popcorn chicken.- Quantity for price does not match up-Buy Again : Perhaps notI think they do better in the specialty menu. I haven't ordered that before but the pictures looks good."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["neutral"]}
