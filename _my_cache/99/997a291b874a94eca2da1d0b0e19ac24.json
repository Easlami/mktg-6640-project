The answer is based on the following text:\nA great place in K-town to come with a group.  Portions are on the large size which is why I recommend coming with a group. Prices aren't bad considering the portion size.  My favorite item is their crab & seafood pasta.  So good!  The braised beef ribs (galbi jjim) is also tasty and great dish to share. The sauce on the tomahawk pork chop katsu is a little to sweet for my taste. The rose Seoul night Tteok Ppoki is a yummy bowl of comfort, it has a combination of rice cakes, dumplings, fish cakes and noodles in a mildly spicy creamy gochujang sauce.  I've noticed a lot of different restaurants by chef Kang  come and go,  I hope this place stays!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
