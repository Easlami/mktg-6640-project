The answer is based on the following text:\nComfort Korean food in Ktown!Came here on the weekend at around 6:30 and only waited for 15 minutes before getting seated. However after us, we saw parties waiting like 30 minutes for a table. The staff are so friendly and quick, we would ask for something and they would quickly give it.The food was good too and price was reasonable. My friend and I were obsessed with the banchan here and ate all of our banchan with nothing left over. We had the kimchi pancake which was cooked with perfect crispyness and softness and the kimchi stew which also came with free servings of rice. The stew was ok but the pancake really stood out for us, try it!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
