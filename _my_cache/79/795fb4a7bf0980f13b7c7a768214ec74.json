The answer is based on the following text:\nI feel like there aren't too many places with outdoor BBQ and I'm so glad my friends and I stumbled onto here! It's also a charcoal BBQ so there's great smokey flavor imbued in all the seafood. For three hungry people, the Master set is the perfect amount of food. We debated the set meant for 2-3 people, but we really wanted the hagfish ($42.99). The price difference between the two sets was about $30 so it made more sense to just go for the Master set (meant for 3-4 people).Staff were attentive and did all of the cooking for us. They'll cut the hinges on the big clams and cut the other pieces of seafood into tiny bits for you. The seafood was delicious and fresh, no fishy taste at all.For the Master set, there is a giant bowl of noodles at the end so remember to keep space for them."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
