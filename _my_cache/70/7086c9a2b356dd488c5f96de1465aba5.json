It was just sausage, cut up mushrooms, imitation crab, etc. I know Ktown food in LA is overpriced but cmonnnn.The bright side is that the beer and soju are $8, service is nice, and they let you take a Korean ice cream from their ice cream fridge.I may come back and try other things in the future."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["neutral"]}
