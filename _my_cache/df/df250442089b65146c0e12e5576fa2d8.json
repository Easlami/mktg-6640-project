The answer is based on the following text:\nI went with a friend and getting two things was way too much, we definitely should have split one thing. But, we didn't regret it because it was really nice to try multiple things. The sujebi and the noodles were both perfectly cooked and chewy, and both soups had deep flavor and were so good. Generous with the amount of clams and seafood too, which was nice! The ambiance definitely is more of a modern vibe than traditional Korean spots, and service is good but there can be pretty decent lines at peak lunch hours, maybe 30 minutes or more (it really depends). Overall, this place is so good and I love recommending it to others, but it has a good reputation anyway."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
