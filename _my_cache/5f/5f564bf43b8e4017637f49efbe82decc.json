The answer is based on the following text:\nThis is one of the best tofu soup places I've been to in LA! Their tofu is so soft it almost melts in your mouth. I got the beef and seafood soup which was amazing. Their spice level was perfect for me (I typically like my food a little hotter than the standard). The banchan was also delicious! I came in 30 mins before closing and there was no wait however, I felt bad because it looked like I was the last to check in. I wanted to try the green onion pancake as well but they said they ran out. I'll definitely be trying that next time! Overall I feel like there's not more to say rather than to check it out yourself!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
