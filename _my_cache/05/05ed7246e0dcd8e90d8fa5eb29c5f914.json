Staff is very friendly and explains what menu items are for first timers.We got large bossam and it was the perfect amount for 5. Bossam came with napa cabbage, kimchi side dishes, and lettuce scallion salad. We also ordered scallion pancake and seafood pancake. My friends really enjoyed them as a starter along with the pork and rice soup. Tastes like home.I have to try the jokbal and gamja tang next time!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
