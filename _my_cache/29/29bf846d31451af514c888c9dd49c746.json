The answer is based on the following text:\nWe went on a Wednesday night to try this place out. We could tell it had opened recently as we saw the good luck plants standing out at the entrance.We ordered the bossam + spicy jokbal combo as well as the Gamja tang.First the bossam:It was very well cooked. The browning seemed to stand out more here. The morsels were tender and perfectly cooked-I could almost feel the collagen plumping up my skin. The spicy jokbal was a new dish for us. I've had the non spicy kind. We ordered the medium spice level, and it was spicy, but not so spicy that it took away from the taste. The sweetness of the sauce helped cut the spice. There will be some bone in this one for those who have never tried this dish. The Gamja tang was just so-so to my taste buds. One person in my party said he really enjoyed the broth as he felt it had a different depth to it than the others he has had before at different restaurants. I personally felt that it tasted \"meatier\" or more gamey hence my lackluster response. But the others I was with really liked it.The service is just like any standard Korean restos-to the point and efficient, no loitering and lingering. The food came out quickly and beers/soju were served promptly at our \"yeogiyo\" requests. This is the kind of service I personally love and prefer!The restaurant has a large tv screen on one wall playing Korean music videos-at least the entire time I was there, that's what was playing. Acoustics make the place a bit loud, so if you are looking for a quiet intimate atmosphere, this is not the place. All in all, pretty good food and service. I'd most likely return again for another round."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
