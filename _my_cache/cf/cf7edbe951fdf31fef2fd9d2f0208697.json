The answer is based on the following text:\nWe went around 5:30 PM on a Friday and got seated in the outdoor area right away. The outdoor seating area was nicely decorated and would be a nice place to chill at night. The food was good but we thought the service could be better.From the beginning, it took awhile for someone to take our order. The set includes fried rice, which is cooked on the same grill after you are done with your meats. After we finished our bbq, no one came to check in on us to see if we would like to order more or if we were ready for our fried rice. We had to flag the staff down multiple times to remind them and we were kept waiting for so long that the oil and remaining vegetables were burnt. When I pointed that out, they did replace the grill for us but we were disappointed the fried rice wouldn't be cooked with all the good meat essence from our bbq (and as expected the fried rice tasted blend).I think for the price point, the service could be better and the staff could be more attentive. When we came it wasn't even that busy so I'm not sure if the service would be even worse during rush hour."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
