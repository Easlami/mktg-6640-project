The answer is based on the following text:\nIt is a restaurant just opened recently. Neat and clean inside. Service is good. We really like the bossam, it is juicy and tasty. For the jokbal, the lean meat is bit dry but the pieces underneath them are very good with the bean paste. They are the pig feet with bone in pieces. The skin is soft and flavorful. The spicy potato beef short ribs soup is good, not too spicy. Definitely it is worth to try."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
