It's like you've been teleported to Korea Out late drinking with friends?? Come to butnal to curve your late night munchies - and to drink some more hehe! The food was delicious and paired so nicely with soju and beer. I wish there was an egg included in the tteokbokki but I still enjoyed it. The restaurant is decorated with Sakura flowers which is SO CUTE! They play kpop in the background. Service is fast and the staff is so friendly! I'm gonna bring all my LA visitors here!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
