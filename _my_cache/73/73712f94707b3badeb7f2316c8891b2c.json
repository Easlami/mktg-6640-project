The answer is based on the following text:\nButnal is a new gastropub that opened up on the border of Mid City and Koreatown. It is so underrated and great! I hope it gets more business but not Tiktok viral... this is truly a gem for the locals. They are having an opening deal where all alcohol is $9. The regular price is $13 -- still way cheaper than the $17 or $18 bottles of soju I see at most places in Koreatown proper. The Â waiter was so nice and offered my friend two free bottles of soju when we told him we're celebrating his birthday. The food was great and very affordable compared to Koreatown. The vibes were also amazing -- it gave a cozy forest aesthetic. Best of all, since it is on the fringe of Koreatown, there is plenty of free street parking. I will definitely come back and bring my friends!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
