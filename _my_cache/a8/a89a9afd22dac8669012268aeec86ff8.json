The answer is based on the following text:\nFinally had the opportunity to try Majordomo!Summary: Good larger group format dining with a focused menu anchored really by a few protein dishes. A few of the sides were really solid too. The protein dishes are more substantial and thereby best to go in groups and share. Be prepared to spend a bit. Recommend sitting in the patio!Details: we had a group of 6 guys and details below on what we ordered. We had a ton of leftovers.. for sure only needed one of the protein dishes, but still happy we tried both. If you had to do one, try the short rib if it's your first time. Potatoes and tomatoes were great. Bings were good, just a bit pricey for what it is. Oysters were very average.1) short rib (pre-order needed): definitely the star of the show! Smoked bone in, carved table side. Great flavor and quality bbq. Leftover carvings were used to then make fried rice. Accoutrements were pretty average. Expensive at $235, but does feed 4-5. Recommend for a special occasion if it's your first time!2) smoked bo ssam (pork shoulder): really great flavor, smokey and sweet. To me it was like high quality pulled pork with asian inspired flavors. Good for sharing.3) crispy potatoes: perfect pairing for the proteins to add some carbs. We ordered two of these4) heirloom tomatoes: super fresh and sweet, balanced perfectly with the sesame vinaigrette. They served this dish as appetizer, would have preferred to have this with the meat to help cut the fat a bit.5) bings: had the butter/honey and the ricotta/compote. Really really good.. freshly griddled bing paired and the dips were both really good. Assuming u are already there to splurge, I'd say get two to try.6) oysters: while fresh, nothing really stood out. Would have expected maybe a bit more at $26 for half dozen.All in all, recommend trying if you haven't been and go in a group!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
