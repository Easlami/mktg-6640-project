However it was already late night nearing midnight, and many KBBQ places couldn't serve us due to the time. Eventually we walked into Woo Hyang Woo and they were still accepting late walk-ins! We were a party of 9, but even with a large group they were able to get us seated quickly and we ended up getting a whole room to ourselves which felt like special treatment!My group split into two different tables. For my table we ordered one of the Woo Hyang Woo Combo D which came with Prime Beef Brisket, Prime Boneless Short Ribs, Prime Boneless Ribeye, and we chose to get the Prime Beef Bulgogi. All the meats were delicious and I liked the banchan that was offered. I think the other table group ordered 2 different combos as well.The service here was also some of the best I've experience in all of Koreatown. The young guy who sat us here had a likeable personality and felt relatable. We also mentioned about the promotion of leaving a yelp review for free soju, and in turn he gave us two free soju bottles for each table. And even though we were trying to cook the KBBQ meats ourselves, the staff offered to do it for us which was nice.All in all, I really like Woo Hyang Woo. I've only tried a couple of KBBQs in Koreatown, but so far this one is my favourite for the time being. I will say that this place can end up a little pricey, but honestly it was worth it."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
