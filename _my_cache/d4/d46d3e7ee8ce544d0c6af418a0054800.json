The other two members of party ordered Galbi Jjim to share, 40 minutes later we were not served, Two other table were served before us, there was only one table before us so it was not busy. I had to go to counter to ask for water and inquire about my order. There was no apology and said rudely that he would bring water to our table . After eating I wave to lady at counter and she saw me but turned her back. Went to counter to ask for check and to go boxes. Â Still no apology, just said there was a shift change and confusion??? We were there from 4 to 5 pm on Sunday. Other tables were served that came in after us . Food is wonderful but service came with attitude."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
