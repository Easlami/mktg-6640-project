The answer is based on the following text:\nYou come here either for galbijjim or salungtang.. we got both. Probably would have been fine with just the galbijjim. There were four of us and we got the large and added cheese. The meat just melted off the bone and we did the spice level medium. We wanted to get the ssalungtang because we needed some type of soup to balance the meal. I suggest getting something smaller. The galbijjim was sufficient for the 4 of us alone.We came around lunch time and it was full. Didn't have to wait too long. There's valet parking so bring some cash. Parking is better here than the other location. You. An always Uber too."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
