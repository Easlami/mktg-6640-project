The answer is based on the following text:\nThis popular dish was excellent and so much fun! Usually people get this dish with cheese on top and a server cones out with a torch and lights it on fire for a really big flame show! I'm allergic to cheese so we got it without but it still very very good. The ban chan was all really nice with the dish. They will give you an option for white rice or brown rice, we went with brown rice and what we got was really really good black rice. So I highly recommend the \"brown\" rice with your dish. The restaurant is not very big so be prepared to wait in line for a table. But the wait is so worth it."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
