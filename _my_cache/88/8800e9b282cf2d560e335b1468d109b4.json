I have been there a total of three times and I can tell one thing for sure is the consistency in the good service and ambiance. Everybody is very friendly and accommodating. I remember arriving early my first time and I was given a nice seat m at the bar where I ordered one of my favorite lemon ginger shiso mocktails before my party arrived.I also remember every one of our servers being very knowledgeable about the menu and being helpful with what to choose in terms of cocktails, appetizers, entr√©es, and desserts. The ambience from the open floor plan makes it very interactive and lively with all the tables filled with people, and sometimes close enough where you can have conversations with people next to you. We remember talking to our neighbor and sharing ideas over which dessert to share and I found that to be super fun and memorable.A number of things stand out from the menu at Majordomo. Off the top of my head I can confidently say that the Bing bread (or Chinese flatbread) is one of the most unique types of bread I've ever tried. We have ordered it every time and it's never disappointed. It's very difficult to choose something other than the butter and truffle honey but I hope that one day I can muster up the courage to try the other sides it comes with.The mushroom fried rice is a delicious entree with a very cool presentation as the server cracks the crusted layer of the rice and mixes it in front of you. Very flavorful.We had a subpar experience last time when we ordered the wagyu steak and did not at all have real wagyu steak in front of us. It was one of the worst experiences we've had with steak before. The meat was extremely chewy - so much that we needed to cut them up into diced cubes to be able to enjoy them. It would have been a choking hazard had we tried to eat them in the slices that had arrived in. Horrible experience. We told the server who was very empathetic and relayed the message to the chef. We got our cocktails taken care of. We will never order it again which was a shame since the marination was delicious.I had been told multiple times by servers in my prior visits that the chickpea mac and cheese is their popular one. We decided to order it and it was actually just alright. Nothing to write home about.The kimchi pasta was a decent plate which was taken off their menu the last time. The fries and steak in my past visits were also much better.If you're looking for something decent, you won't be disappointed here. Unfortunately the quality of the food has not been consistent enough for me to want to return anytime soon.PARKING:Valet across the alley or street parking"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
