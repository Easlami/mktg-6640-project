I had the short rib bowl for myself and the meat was cooked perfectly, paired with a delicious garlic ginger rice. My friends ordered the chicken curry katsu and katsu sando they were both raving about them. Such simple dishes but the attention to detail and high quality ingredients really made the difference. I didn't realize how different their lunch and dinner menus were so I can't wait to be back for dinner another time!I came on a Saturday afternoon and parking was free in their lot."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
