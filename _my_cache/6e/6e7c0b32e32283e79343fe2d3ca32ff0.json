I was there this Saturday and just loved the ambiance as soon as I walked into their patio area. Got there around 5:20 pm, and all the tables were filled by 6 pm. Not sure if it was just that Saturday night, but it was less crowded after 7:30 pm as we were leaving.We ordered Don-Tastic and extra Pork Belly for three. We tried all three pork, and they were all so good. We also had Golbaengi Noodles, and this was also good. It's not the typical spicy golbaengi noodles though.I just loved the ambiance. It almost felt like glamping since we were grilling our meat under the tree and with string lights around the tree. Since it's outdoor, your hair will not smell like bbq. I'm already thinking about going back next weekend."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
