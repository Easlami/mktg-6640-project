Absolutely Waste my money! There is tons of Korea restaurants out there!! ordered Kalbi-tang & BiBimbap, BiBimbap come out cold, it's not on stove, also they give really small amount!!! Â and kalbi-tang is tasteless, also not on stove which they supposed to be on stove, just like they just dump meat at water so much oil and they chopped small pieces!!!I looks so pale don't even have any color on it! it's worst Kalbi-tang I ever had in my life!!! I love Korea food but if this is the korea food will be like, i will never want korea food again! Also this old woman working there, she is not nice! Probably because I'm not korea? Because I see her very nice to Korea customs there!! Races! I really hate restaurants people doing that!!! If you want treat people differently, then don't welcome us!
