The answer is based on the following text:\nGot a groupon and wanted to check this place out, since Chef Kang has a reputation.I got the octopus and the cheese corn. There were complimentary tortilla chips dusted in sugar (a bit too sweet for me) with pico de gallo. The pico was not fresh and was underwhelming. I'd give 3 stars for the octopus. It was plated beautifully, but the sauce and accompanying ingredients were not fresh. The cheese corn was just an oval iron skillet with sweet corn and melted cheese - not worth the price.Ambience - for me, 2 stars. It was not particularly welcoming and too dark inside. I sat outside, a bit better.Service - 3 stars. There was only one other table occupied, server was a bit slow.I went during the week at an off-peak time. The place probably has a more club-like vibe late at night on weekends, but that's not my jam. Will not be back."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
