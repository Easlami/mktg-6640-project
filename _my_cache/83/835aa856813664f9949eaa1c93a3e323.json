I've been wanting to try this place for quiet some time now but I believe their hours were a little weird since they were remodeling, but now they're back and better than ever. Every felt and looked really clean in the inside and it has a very chill drinking type of atmosphere. Our table sat outside and i must say I do prefer that. It felt like a scene out of a Korean drama. We got the grilled eel (it was good but wish it had some type of flavoring), and the chief set. There was 4 of us and I must say we did all get pretty full. One of my favorite has to be their spicy cold noodles. Insane how much flavor was in it I could eat atleast three! Seafood was fresh and the waiters cook for you here, truly better service than anywhere you'll get. Would recommend if you're in the area"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
