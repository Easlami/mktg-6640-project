The answer is based on the following text:\nThis is definitely one of the better locations in terms of food but not service. It has always been busy with a long wait time. Majority of the workers who we have interacted with are curt and rude. They do not explain how ordering works at all either on the menu or directly but expect you to know and then are clearly annoyed at you for when you have questions. We felt super rushed every single time we talked to a worker.Aside from the service, food was amazing. We got the Galbijjim and two soups. Overall, I would rather go to the other locations where the workers treat you better and you don't feel rushed."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["negative"]}
