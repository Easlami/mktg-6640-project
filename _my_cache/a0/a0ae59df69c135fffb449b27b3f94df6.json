The answer is based on the following text:\nFour of us dined here together and it was very lovely! The space is small, but it was not very crowded and it felt very comfortable. The sushi here is very high quality and the flavors were complex and delicious. We had the hibi roll, the spicy tuna roll, and an appetizer which is no longer on the menu. The wait staff was kind and talked us through the menu and their recommendations. I would definitely recommend this place! The fish was so fresh and it was obvious they had high quality ingredients."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
