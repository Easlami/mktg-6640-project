The answer is based on the following text:\nCame up from San Diego and on a whim, realized this place looked really good on yelp, and so I decided to stop in. It's in a fairly unassuming strip mall type of place, but when you walk in, it's immediately obvious that this is a classy establishment. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. My understanding is that their dinner is even more extravagant, but given the limitations of our travel plans, had to settle for lunch. Overall, it was delicious. I thought the Unagi and the octopus were both really delicious, and I would love to come back for dinner. Service was excellent if I haven't said so already."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
