The answer is based on the following text:\nWe got the Chief set and it was pretty filling. We didn't think we would've had enough food but the side noodles and soups were pretty filling and there were food leftover we couldn't take since they didn't have soup containers. Their ceviche was really good and all the waiters/waitress cooked for us! They're all friendly and nice, especially John and Jeff. Enjoyed this place after a long drive from Big Sur. All seafood only, I don't think they have any meat, Atleast I didn't see it? Definitely a good experience"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
