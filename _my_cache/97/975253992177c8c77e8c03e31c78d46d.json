The answer is based on the following text:\nFirst order of business when arriving in LA is always K-BBQ. Although there are so many options in Ktown, since the weather was quite warm, we thought Mun Patio would be perfect on a hot day.We were a bit unsure if we were supposed to go through the front entrance or if the patio had a separate entrance. Since we arrived a couple minutes before opening, we decided to walk around the building to kill some time and found a side entrance with a sign so we peeked in. Although we were STILL early, we were welcomed to take a seat on the patio. The sun was still out but there were several tables in the shade. The tables were situated far from the street entrance so the hustle and bustle of the street is blocked. String lights were hung above, which I would imagine would be beautiful later in the evening.The patio menu is limited, but you are allowed to order from the inside menu. The patio menu includes 3 different meat options, 3 noodle items, and 3 stews/ramen. For 3 people, we ordered the pork set (port shoulder, pork jowl, and pork belly), which comes with fried rice for $65 and added one order of the Kkodorri noodles (definitely recommend). This was the perfect amount of food for us. There was a DIY ramen station if that's what you're craving after some drinks.Our server cooked all of our meat for us and even grilled the kimchi (and potato!), which I love. He recommended what sauces to pair with which meats, which were all great in my opinionThe prices are more than reasonable for the service and quality, especially compared to other K-BBQ places in the vicinity. Definitely would go again and would recommend."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
