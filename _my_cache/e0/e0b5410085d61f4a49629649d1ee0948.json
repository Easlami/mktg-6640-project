The food is just so delectable even though the price is a little bit much. But I believe the food and the service fits the price so that's why I'm giving it all the stars. The sauces and side dishes included gave the dishes a lot of flavor and we asked for extra bowls and stuff and the staff were very accommodating. Definitely coming back here again if I get the chance!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
