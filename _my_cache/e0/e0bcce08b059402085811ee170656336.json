The answer is based on the following text:\nCame here for my sis-in-law's bday dinner. Not an all you can eat establishment, but man was it good! The service was great as well! We ordered the combo D for 4+ people. Came with prime beef brisket, prime boneless short rib, prime boneless ribeye and marinated short rib. We also added the prime tomahawk steak. All the meats were met in your mouth tender. And all the sides were amazing. Nice spot for a nice dinner! Ambiance was also very good. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, but plenty of paid parking available."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
