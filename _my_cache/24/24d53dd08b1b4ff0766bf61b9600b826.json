The answer is based on the following text:\nAnyone looking for some delicious bossam A.k.A Korean boiled pork wrap. This spot hit homemade dish tasting like your mom or grandma recipe. Pork is super flavorful especially with a dipping sauce. The seafood pancake is a must try. Whatever you do don't skip out on it. Super crunchy, crispy loaded with seafood in every bite. Service is A+ for me. Tending my needs in the food service on point. The place is a little small kind of make your dinning experience feel like home. Overall I'll be coming back for round 2 or 3. One more thing bring friends!! Portion size is large. Good for 3-4 people."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
