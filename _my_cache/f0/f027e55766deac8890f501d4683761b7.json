The answer is based on the following text:\nTo start off, the interior is really pretty, modern and clean. Service was great as well, our waitress had a lot of recommendations and she was super attentive. Both the waitress and the owner were very transparent about the composition of the dishes and where ingredients were sourced.For the food, we decided to share the koji butter steak and supplement the meal with more small plates (just make sure that if you want to order the steak, order it first to allot the chef at least 30 min to prepare it). We ordered the Hamachi Crudo, the scallops, and the stuffed chicken wings. The Hamachi crudo was super fresh and the quality of the fish was amazing. The stuffed chicken wings were also pretty good, but I think the next time I come here I'll try something different. On the other hand, the SCALLOPS, were delicious. I grew up vegetarian, and in the past few years, I've never quite warmed up to shellfish, scallops were something I've tried, but never liked. These scallops ended up being so delicious my partner and I ordered a second serving, and the chef was kind enough to add another scallop to our portion! The steak ended up being incredible, but the second most impressive thing was the coal-roasted Korean sweet potato side with some kind of Kimchi sauce. I would eat an entire plate of that, and my partner, who doesn't normally enjoy goguma, would 100% agree.Overall, Hibi was really great and it's been a while since I've had the chance to just sit down and enjoy nice Japanese/Korean food. I'll be coming again to try the miso butter elote and the octopus karaage!"]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
