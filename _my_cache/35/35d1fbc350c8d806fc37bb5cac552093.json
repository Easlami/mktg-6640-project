The answer is based on the following text:\nFirst impression: SOO MUCH FOOD!!When they say 2-3 to me that's like 4-5 persons meal. It's A LOT. All sides are there (potatoes, kilchi, pickles, rice, salads and etc). The flavors just shut you up. I went silent when I started eating. I was in heaven.Second impression: This is the real spicy. So if you order spicy just know it is spicy. If you can't handle it please order non spicy. This is for real and that's my own preference.If like me you have been influenced by instagram Korean gentlemen and gentle ladies eating, then yea you want to order from this restaurant. The look of everything is the same as in their videos, the flavors actually impressed me nothing was too sweet or too salty. Everything is just right.I order bibim bap so fresh, LA Galbi so much meat, sogogi sundubu got gasping, galbi jjim (the beef stew this was the highlight of my order)Anywaysss in conclusion I BOUGHT 2 WEEKS WORTH OF FOOD BY MISTAKE and I don't really regret it."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
