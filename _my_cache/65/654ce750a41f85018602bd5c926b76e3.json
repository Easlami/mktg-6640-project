Our table service was a little on the slower side, so I'm not sure if the young gentleman was new and in training, but there was at one point in time we had to reach out to who I thought was the owner or manager had a location in order to start our order process. The location has a cool concept with multiple dining rooms. We sat on the side that would be considered, possibly more family style oriented based off of the color scheme in the larger tables. The other dining area may be geared more towards more of a outside ambience starlight Ambience the way that it is designed. They have these very unique chips and salsa and the chips have a little sugar sprinkled on them, as this gives off a very fragrant flavorful vibe with the salsa. I would definitely like to revisit this location to try out a few more of their plates from their menu. there are also a lot of different types of international beer selections, whether it be Japanese or Korean beer."]}],"output":["text"],"model":["gemma3:4b"],"seed":[1337],"temperature":[0]},"response":["positive"]}
